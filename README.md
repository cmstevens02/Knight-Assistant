# Knight Assistant

## About
Knight Assistant is a Team Project by University of Central Florida students Nathanael Gaulke, Conroy Ricketts, and Christine Stevens for the Knight Hack's Projects Team. 

Knight Hacks is a Registered Student Organization at the University of Central Florida which specializes in Software Development and its annual Hackathon. The KnightHacks Projects Team is an opportunity for students to be able to work on projects outside of class with other like-minded students.

We started the design process in February and decided to work on a Discord bot to gain more experience working with standard technologies outside of our Computer Science curriculum. We collaborated on GitHub and reviewed each other's commits before merging them into our code base.  We held weekly meetings and also received mentorship from the Projects Team Leaders. We're proud of our project and are glad to show off our demo during the Knight Hacks Projects Showcase.
